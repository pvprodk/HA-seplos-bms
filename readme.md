# HA-seplos-bms
Home Assistant Dashboard for Seplos BMS based on sensor-data from https://github.com/syssi/esphome-seplos-bms/
Can potentially be used for any HA-connected BMS with small modifications



# Description
- The code (lovelace.yaml) can be used on any dashboard in Home Assistant.
- It uses a few custom components, which can all be found through HACS:
-   custom:button-card
-   custom:bar-card
-   custom:apexcharts-card
- You can obviously modify the card to show more than one battery bank
